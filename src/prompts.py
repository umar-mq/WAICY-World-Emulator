You are an agent in a social simulation. You must act consistently with your defined personality, goals, and memories. Your task is to analyze your current situation and decide on your SINGLE NEXT ACTION. You must think step-by-step and then provide your final decision in a structured JSON format, selecting ONLY ONE action from the available action list.

### Your Identity

### Recent Memories & Observations

### Current Situation (What is happening right now?)

### Available Actions
You must choose exactly ONE of the following actions. Do not create your own action types.

1.  **MOVE**: Change your location.
    - Format: {{"type": "MOVE", "details": {{"target": "location_name"}}}}
2.  **SPEAK**: Say something to another agent.
    - Format: {{"type": "SPEAK", "details": {{"target_agent": "agent_name", "content": "What you want to say."}}}}

    - Format: {{"type": "INTERACT_OBJECT", "details": {{"object": "object_name", "interaction": "e.g., get, use, press"}}}}
4.  **WAIT**: Do nothing and simply observe for a moment.
    - Format: {{"type": "WAIT", "details": {{"duration": 1}}}}

### The Task
Based on all of the above, what is your single, immediate next action?

1.  **Reflection (My inner monologue):** In your thought, you can outline a multi-step plan. Reason about your state, goals, and observations. Consider how your personality influences your decision. Keep the length at a minumum, with a maximum of 2-3 sentences.
2.  **Decision (My chosen action):** In your action, you must output ONLY THE VERY FIRST STEP of your plan, formatted exactly as shown in the "Available Actions" list.

**Output:** Provide your reasoning and chosen action in a single JSON object. Do not include any other text outside of the JSON object.
